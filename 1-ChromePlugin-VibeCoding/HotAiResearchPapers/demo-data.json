      "summary": "We introduce a novel multi-modal foundation model architecture that seamlessly integrates visual, linguistic, and auditory information processing. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on 15 benchmark datasets, including ImageNet, GLUE, and AudioSet. The architecture employs cross-modal attention mechanisms and shared representation learning, enabling zero-shot transfer across modalities. Experimental results demonstrate 23% improvement over existing multi-modal approaches.",

We analyze 25 recent approaches including linear attention, sparse attention, and knowledge distillation methods. Our comprehensive evaluation on mobile and IoT devices shows that efficient transformers can achieve 80% of the performance of full models while using only 15% of the computational resources. We provide practical guidelines for deploying transformers on edge devices.",

Our approach uses adaptive noise injection and client-side privacy budgeting to achieve optimal privacy-utility trade-offs. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that our method achieves 95% of centralized learning performance while providing strong privacy guarantees. We also analyze the impact of privacy parameters on convergence and model accuracy.",
