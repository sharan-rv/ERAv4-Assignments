# 🔧 Icon Issue Solution

## Problem
The Chrome extension failed to load because it couldn't find the required PNG icon files.

## ✅ Current Status

## 🎯 To Add Custom Icons (Optional)

### Step 1: Generate Icons
1. Open `icons/generate-icons.html` in your browser
2. Click the download buttons for each icon size
3. Save the files in the `icons` folder:
   - `icon16.png` (16x16 pixels)
   - `icon48.png` (48x48 pixels)
   - `icon128.png` (128x128 pixels)

### Step 2: Update Manifest
Add this to your `manifest.json` file:

```json
"icons": {
  "16": "icons/icon16.png",
  "48": "icons/icon48.png",
  "128": "icons/icon128.png"
}
```

### Step 3: Reload Extension
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Click the refresh button on your extension
3. The custom icons should now appear
